# Conway's Game of Life

Goofing around with Ebiten game engine for Go and [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

NOT production level code :)

This uses torroidal array/game grid (edges wrap around).

## How to run

```
go build && ./cgol <pattern-name>
```

Pattern names: hwss, pulsar, gosper, or simkin.
